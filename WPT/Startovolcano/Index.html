        <h1>Stratovolcanoes</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratovolcano" target="_blank">stratovolcano</a>,also called composite volcano, volcanic landform characterized by a conical shape formed by
            layers of volcanic material deposited during successive volcanic eruptions. Stratovolcanoes tend to slope
            gently at the base but rise quickly near the summit to form tall mountain peaks. They are typically found
            above subduction zones, and they are often part of large volcanically active regions, such as the Ring of
            Fire that frames much of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_ocean" target="_blank">Pacific Ocean.</a> There are more than 700 known volcanoes classified as
            stratovolcanoes, many more than any other volcanic formation. Several are among the best-known volcanoes
            because of their striking appearance and their notoriety for some of the most-spectacular eruptions in
            history

                This unevenness of deposition allows for the development of several vents from which gas and magma can
                escape. Typically, a stratovolcano has one primary vent near its peak. This vent is often located within
                a crater, where material has been blasted away during one or more previous eruptions. The crater may be
                filled with water or ice, or it may contain a volcanic dome during a period of relative inactivity.
                Craters are
                often unstable features, with the location of the vent changing over time. Other vents associated with
                the volcano include fumaroles, which emit gas and vapour. During an eruption, as magma escapes from a
                chamber within the mountain, a large section of the rock above
                may give way, and the chamber may collapse. The result is a a large bowl-shaped volcanic depression
                called acaldera. Calderas are many times larger than the vents that often appear near the top of
                astratovolcano,and they are also larger than volcanic <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/crater/" target="_blank">craters</a>.
                The andesite and dacite rocks common to stratovolcanoes produce cooler and more-viscous lavas than the
                basalt rocks common to shield volcanoes, which produce faster-moving and less-viscous lavas. Thick
                extrusions pile up on previous volcanic deposits around the vent of the stratovolcano, and multiple
                eruptions occurring over thousands of years culminate in tall cone-shaped peaks.
                During an eruption, as magma escapes from a chamber within the mountain, a large section of the rock
                above may give way, and the chamber may collapse. The result is a a large bowl-shaped volcanic
                depression
                called a caldera. Calderas are many times larger than the vents that often appear near the top of a
                stratovolcano,and they are also larger than volcanic craters.
                A stratovolcano's steep slope and composite structure makes its flanks particularly vulnerable to lahars
                (mudflows of volcanic material), avalanches, and landslides caused by the collapse of large sections of
                the mountain. Lahars may be the product of an eruption, or they may result from heavy rain on loose ash
                or
                from an unusually quick melt of ice. The massive flow of water, ash, rock, and other volcanic debris can
                travel great distances to impact communities far from the volcano.

                Stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic
                boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade
                Range, Andes, Campania) or another oceanic plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines,
                Aleutian Islands). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals
                and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the
                asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-subduction-3892831">[1]</a>The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed
                "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends
                to greater depths.<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-subduction-3892831">[2]</a> The water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle
                rock, which then undergoes partial melting, rises (due to its lighter density relative to the
                surrounding mantle rock), and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere. The magma then rises
                through the crust, incorporating silica-rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition.
                When the magma nears the top surface, it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the
                stratovolcano.<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-subduction-3892831">[3]</a>

                The processes that trigger the final eruption remain a question for further research. Possible
                mechanisms include:

                n recorded history, explosive eruptions at subduction zone (convergent-boundary) volcanoes have posed
                the greatest hazard to civilizations.<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-subduction-3892831">[4]</a> Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens,
                Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo, typically erupt with explosive force: the magma is too stiff to allow
                easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence, the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped
                volcanic gases remain and intermingle in the pasty magma. Following the breaching of the vent and the
                opening of the crater, the magma degasses explosively. The magma and gases blast out with high speed and
                full force.<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-subduction-3892831">[5]</a>
